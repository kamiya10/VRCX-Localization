VRCX is an assistant/companion application for VRChat that provides information about and helps you accomplish various things related to VRChat in a more convenient fashion than relying on the plain VRChat client (desktop or VR), or website alone. It also includes some other neat features outlined below.

This repository is for localizations, for main application please go to [vrcx-team/VRCX](https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX).

# Getting Started

<div align="center">

Just go to the [VRCX Project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/vrcx), pick the language you like, and start translating!

If you don't see the language you want on Crowdin, just open a new [Issue](https://github.com/kamiya10/VRCX-Localization/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new_locale.yaml) on this repository, and we'll make it possible.

## Is VRCX against VRChat's TOS?

**No.**

VRCX is an external tool that uses the VRChat API to provide the features it does.

It does not modify the game in any way, only using the API responsibly to provide the features it does. It is not a mod, or a cheat, or any other form of modification to the game.

To see VRChat's stance on API usage, see the #faq channel in the VRChat Discord.
